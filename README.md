# yawullm
 Yet Another (LLM) Web UI, made from 75+ prompts with Gemini!

 This web UI was first showcased in a [r/LocalLLaMA reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1heqo18/a_functional_nicelooking_web_ui_all_written_by/), now made open source with more features!

 ## Features
 - A (subjectively) nice-looking UI based on Material You design!
 - Light & Dark mode, along with some nice color palettes for you to choose from!
 - Made specifically for [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) but can also work with any OpenAI-compatible LLM provider!
 - Basic but usable chat interface with (somewhat working) Markdown rendering, message regeneration, streaming, editing and the ability to export all messages to a JSON file!
 - Just one single HTML file that can be dropped into any browser and used immediately!

 ## Why "yawu" as the name?
 "yawu" stands for Yet Another (LLM) Web UI!

 Why? Simply put: I ran out of ideas. Initially I wanted to name it TumeraWeb as a web-based version of [Tumera](https://github.com/FishiaT/Tumera), a native WinUI 3-based frontend that I haven't gotten back into developing (yet), but I decided to ditch that and just give it this generic name.

 ## Should you use this?
 I'd say: if you want. Well from my limited testing it works fine for basic usage, but as it's mainly written by Gemini expect bugs.
